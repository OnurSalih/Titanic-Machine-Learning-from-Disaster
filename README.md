# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition from kaggle – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.  

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

In this challenge, I built a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
